# How we built it
🧩 Use Python BeautifulSoup for web scraping to find the data regarding investors' trades since they started stock trading

🧩 Use HTML, CSS, Javascript (React) to build a user-friendly interface that retrieves the data when the user types in the investor's name and time range

🧩 Streamlined API Integration: Seamless integration of scraped data into the backend server via Node.js APIs, enhancing the application's functionality and providing valuable insights to users.

🧩 Implementing middleware in Express.js provided us with a deeper understanding of handling authentication, logging, and error management.

🧩 Building scalable and maintainable UIs using React.js. Breaking down the user interface into reusable components allowed us to efficiently manage and update our application.
